Strict constraints prevent unsafe actions and scope creep, while a concise, standardized output format improves communication and auditability across fixes.</narrative> <concepts> <concept>pattern</concept> <concept>why-it-exists</concept> <concept>how-it-works</concept> <concept>trade-off</concept> </concepts> <files_read> </files_read> <files_modified> </files_modified> </observation> # Message 5 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-07T08:46:32.882Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"/Users/mypocketsmells/.codex/sessions/2026/02/06/rollout-2026-02-06T01-18-32-019c31d1-1865-7402-ab81-676d135571d4.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":4838,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770446611}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"apply the fix, rerun tests\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 6 (assistant) <observation> <type>decision</type> <title>Proceed to apply fix and rerun tests</title> <subtitle>Authorized implementation of localized fix with validation via test suite.</subtitle> <facts> <fact>Directive issued to apply the identified fix and rerun tests.</fact> <fact>Working directory set to /Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem.</fact> <fact>Source session log referenced at .codex/sessions/2026/02/06/rollout-2026-02-06T01-18-32-019c31d1-1865-7402-ab81-676d135571d4.jsonl line 4838.</fact> </facts> <narrative>The primary session authorized moving from diagnosis to implementation by applying the localized fix and validating the outcome through the project’s test suite.

MEMORY PROCESSING CONTINUED =========================== # Message 2 (user) Hello memory agent, you are continuing to observe the primary Codex session. <observed_from_primary_session> <user_request>Find and fix bugs in my codebase with minimal, high-confidence changes. Method (grounded + disciplined): 1) Reproduce: run tests/lint/build (or follow the existing repo scripts). If I provided an error, reproduce that exact failure. 2) Localize: identify the smallest set of files/lines involved (stack traces, failing tests, logs). 3) Fix: implement the minimal change that resolves the issue without refactors or unrelated cleanup. 4) Prove: add/update a focused test (or a tight repro) that fails before and passes after. Constraints: - Do NOT invent errors or pretend to run commands you cannot run. Do not rm without my approval - No scope drift: no new features, no UI embellishments, no style overhauls. - If information is missing, state what you can confirm from the repo and what remains unknown. Output: - Summary (3–6 sentences max): what was broken, why, and the fix. - Then ≤5 bullets: What changed, Where (paths), Evidence (tests/logs), Risks, Next steps.</user_request> <requested_at>2026-02-07</requested_at> </observed_from_primary_session> You are a Codex-Mem, a specialized observer tool for creating searchable memory FOR FUTURE SESSIONS. CRITICAL: Record what was LEARNED/BUILT/FIXED/DEPLOYED/CONFIGURED, not what you (the observer) are doing. You do not have access to tools. All information you need is provided in <observed_from_primary_session> messages. Create observations from what you observe - no investigation needed. Your job is to monitor a different Codex session happening RIGHT NOW, with the goal of creating observations and progress summaries as the work is being done LIVE by the user.

Method (grounded + disciplined): 1) Reproduce: run tests/lint/build (or follow the existing repo scripts). If I provided an error, reproduce that exact failure. 2) Localize: identify the smallest set of files/lines involved (stack traces, failing tests, logs). 3) Fix: implement the minimal change that resolves the issue without refactors or unrelated cleanup. 4) Prove: add/update a focused test (or a tight repro) that fails before and passes after. Constraints: - Do NOT invent errors or pretend to run commands you cannot run. Do not rm without my approval - No scope drift: no new features, no UI embellishments, no style overhauls. - If information is missing, state what you can confirm from the repo and what remains unknown. Output: - Summary (3–6 sentences max): what was broken, why, and the fix. - Then ≤5 bullets: What changed, Where (paths), Evidence (tests/logs), Risks, Next steps.</user_request> <requested_at>2026-02-07</requested_at> </observed_from_primary_session> Your job is to monitor a different Claude Code session happening RIGHT NOW, with the goal of creating observations and progress summaries as the work is being done LIVE by the user.

If I provided an error, reproduce that exact failure. 2) Localize: identify the smallest set of files/lines involved (stack traces, failing tests, logs). 3) Fix: implement the minimal change that resolves the issue without refactors or unrelated cleanup. 4) Prove: add/update a focused test (or a tight repro) that fails before and passes after. Constraints: - Do NOT invent errors or pretend to run commands you cannot run. Do not rm without my approval - No scope drift: no new features, no UI embellishments, no style overhauls. - If information is missing, state what you can confirm from the repo and what remains unknown. Output: - Summary (3–6 sentences max): what was broken, why, and the fix. - Then ≤5 bullets: What changed, Where (paths), Evidence (tests/logs), Risks, Next steps.</user_request> <requested_at>2026-02-06</requested_at> </observed_from_primary_session> You are a Claude-Mem, a specialized observer tool for creating searchable memory FOR FUTURE SESSIONS. CRITICAL: Record what was LEARNED/BUILT/FIXED/DEPLOYED/CONFIGURED, not what you (the observer) are doing. You do not have access to tools. All information you need is provided in <observed_from_primary_session> messages. Create observations from what you observe - no investigation needed. Your job is to monitor a different Claude Code session happening RIGHT NOW, with the goal of creating observations and progress summaries as the work is being done LIVE by the user. You are NOT the one doing the work - you are ONLY observing and recording what is being built, fixed, deployed, or configured in the other session. SPATIAL AWARENESS: Tool executions include the working directory (tool_cwd) to help you understand: - Which repository/project is being worked on - Where files are located relative to the project root - How to match requested paths to actual execution paths WHAT TO RECORD -------------- Focus on deliverables and capabilities: - What the system NOW DOES differently (new capabilities) - What shipped to users/production (features, fixes, configs, docs) - Changes in technical domains (auth, data, UI, infra, DevOps, docs) Use verbs like: implemented, fixed, deployed, configured, migrated, optimized, added, refactored ✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (describes what was built): - \"Authentication now supports OAuth2 with PKCE flow\" - \"Deployment pipeline runs canary releases with auto-rollback\" - \"Database indexes optimized for common query patterns\" ❌ BAD EXAMPLES (describes observation process - DO NOT DO THIS): - \"Analyzed authentication implementation and stored findings\" - \"Tracked deployment steps and logged outcomes\" - \"Monitored database performance and recorded metrics\" WHEN TO SKIP ------------ Skip routine operations: - Empty status checks - Package installations with no errors - Simple file listings - Repetitive operations you've already documented - If file related research comes back as empty or not found - **No output necessary if skipping.** IMPORTANT: Continue generating observations from tool use messages using the XML structure below.

Deliverables are standardized to a concise summary and a capped bullet list, improving clarity, accountability, and repeatability across future bugfixes.</narrative> <concepts> <concept>what-changed</concept> <concept>pattern</concept> <concept>why-it-exists</concept> <concept>problem-solution</concept> </concepts> <files_read></files_read> <files_modified> <file>codex-history.jsonl</file> </files_modified> </observation> # Message 7 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-06T08:13:57.471Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"codex-history.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":287,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770362149}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"yes, do another pass\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 8 (assistant) <observation> <type>decision</type> <title>Second bugfix pass authorized</title> <subtitle>Repository history records approval to run another iteration.</subtitle> <facts> <fact>Entry logged in codex-history.jsonl at line 287 with timestamp 1770362149</fact> <fact>History entry text is \"yes, do another pass\"</fact> <fact>Decision authorizes a second iteration of the established bugfix protocol</fact> <fact>Constraints and deliverables for minimal, test-verified fixes remain unchanged</fact> </facts> <narrative>A codex-history entry documents approval to proceed with another cycle of the disciplined bugfix workflow.

The cause was fallback logic that only switched directories when the primary directory was missing, not when the primary directory existed but lacked today’s log file. I made a minimal script-only fix to probe codex and legacy log names in both the primary and legacy data dirs. I then added a focused test that fails on the pre-fix behavior and passes with the fix, and re-ran full repo checks.\\\\n\\\\n- What changed: Updated `worker:logs` and `worker:tail` fallback resolution to check `codex-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` and `claude-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` in both primary and legacy dirs; added one focused infra test for legacy-dir fallback behavior.\\\\n- Where (paths): `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:56`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:57`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts:43`.\\\\n- Evidence (tests/logs): Pre-fix repro returned `exit=1` with `tail: .../.codex-mem/logs/codex-mem-<date>.log: No such file`; new targeted test initially failed (`Expected: 0 Received: 1`), then passed after fix (`bun test /Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts`); full checks now pass (`npm run test`: `834 pass, 0 fail`; `npm run build`: success). No `lint` script exists in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json`, so lint was not runnable via repo scripts.\\\\n- Risks: If no log file exists in any checked location, `tail` still fails (expected), and behavior remains shell-dependent for these npm script commands.\\\\n- Next steps: 1. If you want friendlier UX, I can add a minimal guard to print a clear “no log file found” message before exiting.\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 8 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-06T08:19:31.554Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"codex-history.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":983,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770363579}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it doesnt seem to be recording output\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 9 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-06T08:19:31.555Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"codex-history.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":1296,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770364233}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Next steps: Run ingestion again to backfill sessions with corrected assistant output in summaries (if you want, I can run the exact backfill command next).\\\\nLet's do this\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 10 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-06T08:19:31.557Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"codex-history.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":1352,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770364394}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"I am logged into Codex, this isn't supposed to work for Claude anymore.

This is a checkpoint to capture progress so far. The session is ongoing - you may receive more requests and tool executions after this summary. Write \"next_steps\" as the current trajectory of work (what's actively being worked on or coming up next), not as post-session future work. Always write at least a minimal summary explaining current progress, even if work is still in early stages, so that users see a summary output tied to each request. Claude's Full Response to User: You’re correct: it is not Codex-native right now. I verified the current pipeline is still Claude-first, so Codex login alone does not power observation/summary generation. What I confirmed: - Default provider is still `claude` in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/shared/SettingsDefaultsManager.ts:68`, and your live settings are also `CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER: \"claude\"` in `/Users/mypocketsmells/.claude-mem/settings.json`. - Provider validation does not allow `codex` (`\"claude\" | \"gemini\" | \"openrouter\"`) in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/http/routes/SettingsRoutes.ts:235`. - Session routing falls back to Claude SDK when not Gemini/OpenRouter in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/http/routes/SessionRoutes.ts:68` and uses Anthropic SDK in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts:27`. - Codex ingestion/hook summarize still calls `/api/sessions/summarize` (`/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/bin/ingest-codex-history.ts:297`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/cli/handlers/summarize.ts:47`), which triggers the provider pipeline above. - Runtime symptom matches this: prompts are stored, but `/api/observations` and `/api/summaries` for `project=codex-mem` are empty. What needs to be done to make it functional with Codex: 1. Add a real `codex` provider (not just adapter naming) and wire it into provider selection/validation/UI. 2. Implement a `CodexAgent` path for observation+summary generation (either via `codex exec` or OpenAI Responses API), then feed output through existing parser/storage flow. 3. Update defaults to Codex-first (`provider`, model defaults, and canonical data dir), while keeping legacy key aliases for migration compatibility. 4. Add a fallback mode for ingestion so assistant output still persists even if provider inference fails (prevents “prompts-only” behavior). 5. Then rerun backfill once this provider path is live. If you want, I can implement phase 1 now with minimal scope: `codex` provider wiring + Codex-backed summary/observation generation path, then re-run ingestion and verify observations/summaries appear.

The cause was fallback logic that only switched directories when the primary directory was missing, not when the primary directory existed but lacked today’s log file. I made a minimal script-only fix to probe codex and legacy log names in both the primary and legacy data dirs. I then added a focused test that fails on the pre-fix behavior and passes with the fix, and re-ran full repo checks.\\\\n\\\\n- What changed: Updated `worker:logs` and `worker:tail` fallback resolution to check `codex-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` and `claude-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` in both primary and legacy dirs; added one focused infra test for legacy-dir fallback behavior.\\\\n- Where (paths): `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:56`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:57`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts:43`.\\\\n- Evidence (tests/logs): Pre-fix repro returned `exit=1` with `tail: .../.codex-mem/logs/codex-mem-<date>.log: No such file`; new targeted test initially failed (`Expected: 0 Received: 1`), then passed after fix (`bun test /Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts`); full checks now pass (`npm run test`: `834 pass, 0 fail`; `npm run build`: success). No `lint` script exists in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json`, so lint was not runnable via repo scripts.\\\\n- Risks: If no log file exists in any checked location, `tail` still fails (expected), and behavior remains shell-dependent for these npm script commands.\\\\n- Next steps: 1. If you want friendlier UX, I can add a minimal guard to print a clear “no log file found” message before exiting.\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 8 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-06T08:19:31.554Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"codex-history.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":983,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770363579}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it doesnt seem to be recording output\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 9 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-06T08:19:31.555Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"codex-history.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":1296,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770364233}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Next steps: Run ingestion again to backfill sessions with corrected assistant output in summaries (if you want, I can run the exact backfill command next).\\\\nLet's do this\\\"}\"</outcome> </observed_from_primary_session> # Message 10 (user) <observed_from_primary_session> <what_happened>CodexHistoryEntry</what_happened> <occurred_at>2026-02-06T08:19:31.557Z</occurred_at> <working_directory>/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem</working_directory> <parameters>\"{\\\"source\\\":\\\"codex-history.jsonl\\\",\\\"line_number\\\":1352,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770364394}\"</parameters> <outcome>\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"I am logged into Codex, this isn't supposed to work for Claude anymore.

This is a checkpoint to capture progress so far. The session is ongoing - you may receive more requests and tool executions after this summary. Write \"next_steps\" as the current trajectory of work (what's actively being worked on or coming up next), not as post-session future work. Always write at least a minimal summary explaining current progress, even if work is still in early stages, so that users see a summary output tied to each request. Claude's Full Response to User: You’re correct: it is not Codex-native right now. I verified the current pipeline is still Claude-first, so Codex login alone does not power observation/summary generation. What I confirmed: - Default provider is still `claude` in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/shared/SettingsDefaultsManager.ts:68`, and your live settings are also `CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER: \"claude\"` in `/Users/mypocketsmells/.claude-mem/settings.json`. - Provider validation does not allow `codex` (`\"claude\" | \"gemini\" | \"openrouter\"`) in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/http/routes/SettingsRoutes.ts:235`. - Session routing falls back to Claude SDK when not Gemini/OpenRouter in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/http/routes/SessionRoutes.ts:68` and uses Anthropic SDK in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts:27`. - Codex ingestion/hook summarize still calls `/api/sessions/summarize` (`/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/bin/ingest-codex-history.ts:297`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/cli/handlers/summarize.ts:47`), which triggers the provider pipeline above. - Runtime symptom matches this: prompts are stored, but `/api/observations` and `/api/summaries` for `project=codex-mem` are empty. What needs to be done to make it functional with Codex: 1. Add a real `codex` provider (not just adapter naming) and wire it into provider selection/validation/UI. 2. Implement a `CodexAgent` path for observation+summary generation (either via `codex exec` or OpenAI Responses API), then feed output through existing parser/storage flow. 3. Update defaults to Codex-first (`provider`, model defaults, and canonical data dir), while keeping legacy key aliases for migration compatibility. 4. Add a fallback mode for ingestion so assistant output still persists even if provider inference fails (prevents “prompts-only” behavior). 5. Then rerun backfill once this provider path is live. If you want, I can implement phase 1 now with minimal scope: `codex` provider wiring + Codex-backed summary/observation generation path, then re-run ingestion and verify observations/summaries appear.

Method (grounded + disciplined): 1) Reproduce: run tests/lint/build (or follow the existing repo scripts). If I provided an error, reproduce that exact failure. 2) Localize: identify the smallest set of files/lines involved (stack traces, failing tests, logs). 3) Fix: implement the minimal change that resolves the issue without refactors or unrelated cleanup. 4) Prove: add/update a focused test (or a tight repro) that fails before and passes after. Constraints: - Do NOT invent errors or pretend to run commands you cannot run. Do not rm without my approval - No scope drift: no new features, no UI embellishments, no style overhauls. - If information is missing, state what you can confirm from the repo and what remains unknown. Output: - Summary (3–6 sentences max): what was broken, why, and the fix. - Then ≤5 bullets: What changed, Where (paths), Evidence (tests/logs), Risks, Next steps.</user_request> <requested_at>2026-02-06</requested_at> </observed_from_primary_session> You are a Claude-Mem, a specialized observer tool for creating searchable memory FOR FUTURE SESSIONS.

If I provided an error, reproduce that exact failure. 2) Localize: identify the smallest set of files/lines involved (stack traces, failing tests, logs). 3) Fix: implement the minimal change that resolves the issue without refactors or unrelated cleanup. 4) Prove: add/update a focused test (or a tight repro) that fails before and passes after. Constraints: - Do NOT invent errors or pretend to run commands you cannot run. Do not rm without my approval - No scope drift: no new features, no UI embellishments, no style overhauls. - If information is missing, state what you can confirm from the repo and what remains unknown.

The cause was fallback logic that only switched directories when the primary directory was missing, not when the primary directory existed but lacked today’s log file. I made a minimal script-only fix to probe codex and legacy log names in both the primary and legacy data dirs. I then added a focused test that fails on the pre-fix behavior and passes with the fix, and re-ran full repo checks.\\\\n\\\\n- What changed: Updated `worker:logs` and `worker:tail` fallback resolution to check `codex-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` and `claude-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` in both primary and legacy dirs; added one focused infra test for legacy-dir fallback behavior.\\\\n- Where (paths): `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:56`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:57`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts:43`.\\\\n- Evidence (tests/logs): Pre-fix repro returned `exit=1` with `tail: .../.codex-mem/logs/codex-mem-<date>.log: No such file`; new targeted test initially failed (`Expected: 0 Received: 1`), then passed after fix (`bun test /Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts`); full checks now pass (`npm run test`: `834 pass, 0 fail`; `npm run build`: success). No `lint` script exists in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json`, so lint was not runnable via repo scripts.\\\\n- Risks: If no log file exists in any checked location, `tail` still fails (expected), and behavior remains shell-dependent for these npm script commands.\\\\n- Next steps: 1.

This is a checkpoint to capture progress so far. The session is ongoing - you may receive more requests and tool executions after this summary. Write \"next_steps\" as the current trajectory of work (what's actively being worked on or coming up next), not as post-session future work. Always write at least a minimal summary explaining current progress, even if work is still in early stages, so that users see a summary output tied to each request. Claude's Full Response to User: You’re correct: it is not Codex-native right now. I verified the current pipeline is still Claude-first, so Codex login alone does not power observation/summary generation. What I confirmed: - Default provider is still `claude` in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/shared/SettingsDefaultsManager.ts:68`, and your live settings are also `CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER: \"claude\"` in `/Users/mypocketsmells/.claude-mem/settings.json`. - Provider validation does not allow `codex` (`\"claude\" | \"gemini\" | \"openrouter\"`) in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/http/routes/SettingsRoutes.ts:235`. - Session routing falls back to Claude SDK when not Gemini/OpenRouter in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/http/routes/SessionRoutes.ts:68` and uses Anthropic SDK in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts:27`. - Codex ingestion/hook summarize still calls `/api/sessions/summarize` (`/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/bin/ingest-codex-history.ts:297`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/src/cli/handlers/summarize.ts:47`), which triggers the provider pipeline above. - Runtime symptom matches this: prompts are stored, but `/api/observations` and `/api/summaries` for `project=codex-mem` are empty. What needs to be done to make it functional with Codex: 1. Add a real `codex` provider (not just adapter naming) and wire it into provider selection/validation/UI. 2. Implement a `CodexAgent` path for observation+summary generation (either via `codex exec` or OpenAI Responses API), then feed output through existing parser/storage flow. 3. Update defaults to Codex-first (`provider`, model defaults, and canonical data dir), while keeping legacy key aliases for migration compatibility. 4. Add a fallback mode for ingestion so assistant output still persists even if provider inference fails (prevents “prompts-only” behavior). 5. Then rerun backfill once this provider path is live. If you want, I can implement phase 1 now with minimal scope: `codex` provider wiring + Codex-backed summary/observation generation path, then re-run ingestion and verify observations/summaries appear.

Method (grounded + disciplined): 1) Reproduce: run tests/lint/build (or follow the existing repo scripts). If I provided an error, reproduce that exact failure. 2) Localize: identify the smallest set of files/lines involved (stack traces, failing tests, logs). 3) Fix: implement the minimal change that resolves the issue without refactors or unrelated cleanup. 4) Prove: add/update a focused test (or a tight repro) that fails before and passes after. Constraints: - Do NOT invent errors or pretend to run commands you cannot run. Do not rm without my approval - No scope drift: no new features, no UI embellishments, no style overhauls. - If information is missing, state what you can confirm from the repo and what remains unknown.
