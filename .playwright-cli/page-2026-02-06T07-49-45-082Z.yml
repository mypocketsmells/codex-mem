      - generic [ref=e36]: "it appears we found this issue in another thread. `npm run test` and `npm run build` were green initially, so I reproduced a concrete runtime bug in the changed log-script area instead of guessing: `npm run worker:logs` failed when `~/.codex-mem/logs` existed but the only log file was in `~/.claude-mem/logs`. The cause was fallback logic that only switched directories when the primary directory was missing, not when the primary directory existed but lacked today’s log file. I made a minimal script-only fix to probe codex and legacy log names in both the primary and legacy data dirs. I then added a focused test that fails on the pre-fix behavior and passes with the fix, and re-ran full repo checks. - What changed: Updated `worker:logs` and `worker:tail` fallback resolution to check `codex-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` and `claude-mem-YYYY-MM-DD.log` in both primary and legacy dirs; added one focused infra test for legacy-dir fallback behavior. - Where (paths): `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:56`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json:57`, `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts:43`. - Evidence (tests/logs): Pre-fix repro returned `exit=1` with `tail: .../.codex-mem/logs/codex-mem-<date>.log: No such file`; new targeted test initially failed (`Expected: 0 Received: 1`), then passed after fix (`bun test /Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/tests/infrastructure/package-scripts.test.ts`); full checks now pass (`npm run test`: `834 pass, 0 fail`; `npm run build`: success). No `lint` script exists in `/Users/mypocketsmells/Documents/GitHub/codex-mem/package.json`, so lint was not runnable via repo scripts. - Risks: If no log file exists in any checked location, `tail` still fails (expected), and behavior remains shell-dependent for these npm script commands. - Next steps: 1. If you want friendlier UX, I can add a minimal guard to print a clear “no log file found” message before exiting."

If I provided an error, reproduce that exact failure. 2) Localize: identify the smallest set of files/lines involved (stack traces, failing tests, logs). 3) Fix: implement the minimal change that resolves the issue without refactors or unrelated cleanup. 4) Prove: add/update a focused test (or a tight repro) that fails before and passes after. Constraints: - Do NOT invent errors or pretend to run commands you cannot run. Do not rm without my approval - No scope drift: no new features, no UI embellishments, no style overhauls. - If information is missing, state what you can confirm from the repo and what remains unknown.

Document Requirements - Title the document \"Repository Guidelines\". - Use Markdown headings (#, ##, etc.) for structure. - Keep the document concise. 200-400 words is optimal. - Keep explanations short, direct, and specific to this repository. - Provide examples where helpful (commands, directory paths, naming patterns). - Maintain a professional, instructional tone. Recommended Sections Project Structure & Module Organization - Outline the project structure, including where the source code, tests, and assets are located. Build, Test, and Development Commands - List key commands for building, testing, and running locally (e.g., npm test, make build). - Briefly explain what each command does. Coding Style & Naming Conventions - Specify indentation rules, language-specific style preferences, and naming patterns. - Include any formatting or linting tools used. Testing Guidelines - Identify testing frameworks and coverage requirements. - State test naming conventions and how to run tests. Commit & Pull Request Guidelines - Summarize commit message conventions found in the project’s Git history. - Outline pull request requirements (descriptions, linked issues, screenshots, etc.).

All bundled files have com.apple.provenance extended attributes indicating macOS security tracking. PyInstaller-created files have metadata conflicts with code signing that require stripping resource forks (xattr -cr) for proper execution. Python 3 is invoked as python3 rather than python on this system.

Instead of overwriting, macOS creates numbered copies. The duplicates included PyInstaller packaging artifacts (.toc, .pyz, .pkg files), Next.js compiled outputs, Python virtual environment binaries, and git worktree metadata from parallel feature branch development. The project uses git worktrees for feature isolation with branches like whale-wallet-tracking, backtesting-engine, arbitrage-scanner, and multi-chain-hd-wallet-system, all managed under an auto-claude namespace suggesting automated development workflows.

Instead of overwriting existing files, macOS creates numbered copies (file 2, file 3, etc.) to prevent accidental data loss. These duplicates represent older build artifacts from previous packaging attempts and are not needed for distribution.

Portfolio Optimizer implements Markowitz optimization with configurable historical data (30-730 days) and 4.5% risk-free rate. Alerts system supports price thresholds and whale activity monitoring. macOS code signing requires proper resource structure matching - AppleDouble files and extended attributes can cause signature validation failures. GitHub Actions builds blocked by billing/spending limit issues, not code problems.
